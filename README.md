# Movie Search

This project is an Android application where you can search for movie information through integration with the [OMDb API](https://www.omdbapi.com/). The project was created as part of a selection process requirement.

## How to Run the Application

You will need:

- Android SDK  
- Flutter SDK  
- An Android device in developer mode (if you want to run it on a physical device. You can also run it locally in the browser in a web version).

To run the app, youâ€™ll need to create a **.env** file based on the provided **.env.example**, including your `API_KEY` from the [OMDb API](https://www.omdbapi.com/).  
The API key will be sent to the selection team via email for security purposes.

Once the `.env` file is added, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
flutter run
```

## About the Project

The project was created following the specified requirements, such as the use of `Dio`, `Bloc`, and `shared_preferences` libraries, and a layered architecture.  
Best practices like *clean code* principles and separation of concerns were followed, where business logic is isolated from the UI using Bloc.

The result is a simple yet effective movie search app, with a clean and responsive interface.

## ðŸ’¡ Future Ideas

- Integrate with Firebase for account creation and authentication.  
- Use a dedicated dependency injection library.  
- Add the ability to mark movies as favorites and store them locally.  
- Create a dedicated tab to show favorite movies.
